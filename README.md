Installation

    There should be no necessary libraries since all necessary packages are included at the beginning of the notebook.

Project Motivation

    For this project, I was interestested in using AirBnB data from Seattle and Boston to gather some insights. 3 Key questions were answered:

    How did the number of hosts grow over time? Are there any seasonal peaks and how does this compare from Boston to Seattle?
    Is there a correaltion between the host features and the price they can charge? Do people from Boston to Seattle weight these attributes differently?
    How do hosts get good reviews? What you should focus on and are the trends the same for Seattle and Boston homes?

Files

    There is one notebook as well as the datasets available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Additionally the data used for the analyzes was downloaded from kaggle and is also included here.
